# The Resource Collection #

### PERN Stack App ###

Built for the students at Galvanize Inc participating in the Operation Level Up immersive to contain
all of our resources in one singular location as opposed to our typical Slack and Discord channels.

At the moment, the app allows global CRUD functionality to all users who have access to it.
I am working on remedying this by implementing authentication using Auth0 in hopes of giving
each user control over their own posts.
